Active contributor to [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) with **50+ merged PRs** and creator of [LangChain Salesforce](https://github.com/colesmcintosh/langchain-salesforce).

I help **design, build, and deploy custom AI systems** â€” from **multi-agent orchestration** to **LLM optimization** to **vector search infrastructure**. If youâ€™re looking to bring AI into your business in a way thatâ€™s **scalable, reliable, and production-ready**, this is what I do.
