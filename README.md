**Full Stack Engineer & Founder**

Specializing in LLMs and AI, I build end-to-end applications spanning modern front-end interfaces and scalable back-end systems. I architect AI-powered solutions including agentic workflows, RAG pipelines, and LLM-based data extraction frameworks. I work across the full technology stack, deploying production systems on AWS, Azure, and GCP, and contribute to open-source AI frameworks that reduce complexity through clear abstractions and intentional design.

## Open Source Contributions

- **[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/)** - Popular framework for building LLM-powered applications and agents
- **[Goose](https://www.colemcintosh.io/)** - Block's Goose project, an open source initiative for AI Agents
- **[Smol Agents](https://www.colemcintosh.io/)** - Huggingface's project focused on lightweight, efficient AI agents
- **[LiteLLM](https://www.colemcintosh.io/)** - Open-source LLM Gateway that allows calling 100+ LLM APIs in the OpenAI format
