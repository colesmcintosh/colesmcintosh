# LLMs, Multi-Agent Systems, and AI Research
I'm Cole McIntosh, on a mission to push the boundaries of large language models and multi-agent systems. As a contributor to [LiteLLM](https://github.com/colesmcintosh/litellm) and the creator of the official [LangChain Salesforce Integration](https://github.com/colesmcintosh/langchain-salesforce), I explore innovative AI research and solutions.

**Research Focus**
- Scalable, production-grade multi-agent architectures
- High-performance LLM optimization at scale
- Vector search and similarity optimization

## Featured Projects
- [chain-of-thought-reranking](https://github.com/colesmcintosh/chain-of-thought-reranking): an approach to optimizing large language model (LLM) responses by extracting, reranking, and refining their internal chain-of-thought (CoT).
- [langchain-salesforce](https://github.com/colesmcintosh/langchain-salesforce): Langchain integration for Salesforce CRM, providing tools for SOQL queries, object schema inspection, and CRUD operations through Langchain's framework.
- [vector-vault](https://github.com/colesmcintosh/vector-vault): a high-performance vector similarity search engine with LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing) optimization, written in Go.
- [pycuda-numpy-vector-ops](https://github.com/colesmcintosh/pycuda-numpy-vector-ops): accelerating NumPy vector operations with PyCUDA in Jupyter notebooks.
- [logit-control](https://github.com/colesmcintosh/logit-control): control LLM token generation by directly manipulating logits to enforce structured outputs, demonstrated using Hugging Face Transformers and Qwen2.5-0.5B.
- [social-media-agent-system](https://github.com/colesmcintosh/social-media-agent-system): a sophisticated multi-agent system combining specialized AI agents to create engaging social media content, leveraging a research agent for gathering accurate, up-to-date information.
