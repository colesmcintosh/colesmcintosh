# What am I doing?
Trying to do the best research I can in LLM's, reasoning, and multi-agent systems. Contributor to [LiteLLM](https://github.com/colesmcintosh/litellm) and creator of the official [LangChain Salesforce Integration](https://github.com/colesmcintosh/langchain-salesforce).

Currently doing research about advancing LLM reasoning capabilities through entropy injection research, developing production-grade multi-agent architectures, and optimizing large language model performance at scale.
